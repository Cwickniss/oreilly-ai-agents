# AI Agents A-Z

This repository contains code for the [O'Reilly Live Online Training for AI Agents A-Z](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/ai-agents-a-z/0642572007604)

This course provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and managing AI agents both at the prototype stage and in production. Attendees will start with foundational concepts and progressively delve into more advanced topics, including various frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, and AutoGen as well as building agents from scratch using powerful prompt engineering techniques. The course emphasizes practical application, guiding participants through hands-on exercises to implement and deploy AI agents, evaluate their performance, and iterate on their designs. We will go over key aspects like cost projections, open versus closed source options, and best practices are thoroughly covered to equip attendees with the knowledge to make informed decisions in their AI projects.


## Setup Instructions

1. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**

   Create a virtual environment using Python 3.10:

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   With the virtual environment activated, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   You might need to do:
   
	```bash
	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
	```


## Notebooks

In the activated environment, run

```bash
python3 -m jupyter notebook
```
